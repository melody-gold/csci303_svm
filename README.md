# CSCI303: Data Science - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

#### *Melody Goldanloo*

## Overview
This project applies Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify Parkinsonâ€™s Disease using biomedical voice data. It evaluates multiple kernels (linear, polynomial, and RBF) and compares their performance based on key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Key Features
- ### Data Preprocessing:
    - Handled missing values and standardized features.
    - Visualized feature distributions and relationships.
- ### Model Development:
    - Trained SVM classifiers with linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels.
    - Tuned hyperparameters like `C` and `gamma` for optimization.
- ### Evaluation Metrics:
    - Assessed model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.

## Technologies Used
### Libraries
- `pandas` - Data manipulation and preprocessing.
- `numpy` - Mathematical operations and handling arrays.
- `scikit-learn` - Model building and evaluation.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` - Data visualization.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Parkinson's Disease Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/parkinsons.data)
- **Description:**
    - 195 samples with 23 features each.
    - Includes voice measurements used to distinguish between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's Disease.
    - Target variable: status (1 = Parkinson's, 0 = Healthy).
 
## Installatation and Usage
1. Clone this repository:
